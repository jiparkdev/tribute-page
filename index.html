        The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory,
        Einstein was born in the German Empire but moved to Switzerland in 1895
        and renounced his German citizenship in 1896. Specialising in physics
        and mathematics, he received his academic diploma from the Swiss Federal
        Polytechnic School in ZÃ¼rich in 1900. The following year, he acquired
        Swiss citizenship. After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to
        1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in
        Bern.
